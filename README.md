# Java-delegate

Simple example of a client delegating tasks to a server, using the 3 following collaborative protocols :
* SOURCEColl
* BYTEColl
* OBJECTColl

There are two projects :
* java-delegate-client
  * Set the output directory to ./out/production/java-delegate-client
* java-delegate-server

First run the server, then the client. On the server side, the files received from the client will be saved on the "delegated" folder.
